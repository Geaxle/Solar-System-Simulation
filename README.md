# Solar-System-Simulation
Program made by Alexis during the month of October 2016.
The aim of the project was to improve and demonstrate my knowledge of Unity and of orbital mechanics.

The MIT license of this project covers only my work. The content of any file of the project that contains a license is not covered by this license but by the one in the file. These other license are the one given by the author of the external works used in this project.

This is a rougtly accurate simulation of the solar system using the Keplerian equations with orbital elements at epoch J2000. Scales of orbits and bodies not in sync but accurate.

LIMITS
- Moon orbit mutliplied by 1000 (otherwise we wouldn't see it)
- Some inacuracies in the orbital elements as detailed on the JPL website. (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?planets)
- Limits in the scales due to 32bit precision as well as the distance view of the camera
